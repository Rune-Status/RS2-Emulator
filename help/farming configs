Allotments
Fally + Catherby
config 504

Fally
NW is just value
SE is (value << 8) << 16
NW + SE is ((se << 8) + nw) << 16

Catherby
S is value << 8
N is (1 << 8) + value
N + S is (value << 8) + value

Will post more and such as I figure them out. Other two allotments should use that same patterns just config is 505 instead of 504. Will test tomorrow.
